Editor debugger plugin for Godot Engine 3
=============================================

This plugin allows you to inspect the editor's scene tree itself, within the editor.
It's a bit the same concept as a web browser element inspector.

You can also select `Control` nodes visually by pressing `F12` with the mouse on top of them.

You can also right click any item within the tree to reveal a context menu with a `Save branch as scene` button. This button allows you to save a branch of the editor tree as a scene.


How to install
-----------------

This is a regular editor plugin.
Copy the contents of `addons/zylann.editor_debugger` into the same folder in your project, and activate it in your project settings.
